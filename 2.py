#Instructions
#The lists we've been working with are in the code editor.

#1.Determine the index number of the track_name element 'Instagram' in row_2, and store the answer as an integer in a variable named track_name_index.
#For example, the currency element 'USD' of row_1 is index number 2, so we'd write currency_index = 2.

#2.Determine the index number of the user_rating element 4.5 in row_3, and store the answer as an integer in a variable named user_rating_index.

row_1 = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
row_2 = ['Instagram', 0.0, 'USD', 2161558, 4.5]
row_3 = ['Clash of Clans', 0.0, 'USD', 2130805, 4.5]


track_name_index = 0 # Remember, the index always starts at 0
user_rating_index = 4 # Fifth position in the list equals index 4
