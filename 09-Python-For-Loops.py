#Instructions
#Use the new technique we've learned to print all app names in the app_names list. We've provided this list in the code editor to the right.

#1-Translate this pattern into Python syntax: for each element in the app_names list, print the app name.
#-Indent the print() statement by four spaces.

app_names = ['Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Clash of Clans', 'Fruit Ninja Classic', 'Minecraft: Pocket Edition']

for element in app_names:
    print(element)
